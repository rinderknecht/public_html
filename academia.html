<h2>In short</h2>

<p>My research interests lie in
  applying <a href="http://vl.fmnet.info/">formal methods</a>, making
  a better life for the engineers, in a broad sense, and considering
  information systems and telecommunication technologies.</p>

<p><strong>In keywords:</strong> XML databases (XQuery), document
  processing (XSLT), telecommunication protocols, specification-based
  test generation, theoretical aspects of programming languages (e.g.,
  type systems), symbolic computing, functional and logic programming,
  static analysis, compilers.</p>

<h2>Telecommunication, Symbolic Computing, Formal Methods and Languages</h2> 

<p>I studied for my
M.Sc. at <a href="http://www.upmc.fr/">Universit&eacute; Pierre et
Marie Curie</a> (Paris, France), from 1991 to 1993. My courses were
under the complementary fields of industrial software engineering and
theoretical computer science. Since then, I always tried to fertilise
the former with the latter. My thesis was about metacompilation, more
precisely, the automatic derivation of a compiler from an algebraic
specification (continuation-passing style semantics).</p>

<p>I moved to <a href="http://www.inria.fr/index.en.html">INRIA</a>
(French national research institute on informatics), in Rocquencourt,
to start my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a
 href="http://www.mauny.net/">Michel Mauny</a>, in the team which
developped both the <strong>functional programming</strong> language
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a> and the proof assistant <a
 href="http://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> (now two groups: <a
 href="http://gallium.inria.fr/">Gallium</a> and <a
 href="http://typical.inria.fr/">TypiCal</a>). In partnership with
CNET (now Orange Labs), I formalised the <strong>specification
language</strong> ASN.1, in use in the specifications of
<strong>telecommunication protocols</strong>, especially oriented
towards managing network equipments. Previous attempts were based on
the specification language language <tt>Z</tt>, which is based on the
powerful Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Instead, I provided an
operational approach which lead more easily to a specification
analyser in OCaml. The working prototype was used in the industry for
some time and the thesis included theoretical results about its
features and analyses (as syntatic completeness and correctness of the
Basic Encoding Rules). During this period I represented France at the
ISO working committee on ASN.1 (London, 1997) with Michel Mauny. I
finished this work in 1998. I taught computer science and mathematics
to undergraduates during these years.</p>

<p>I worked at Alcatel-Alsthom Research
(now <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/">Alcatel-Lucent
R&amp;I</a>) from 1997 to 1998, where I conducted case studies for
operational subsidiaries about telecommunication software
quality.</p>

<p>In 1998, I joined the <a href="http://www.it-sudparis.eu/">Institut
National des T&eacute;l&eacute;communications</a> (now
T&eacute;l&eacutecom SudParis), the second best engineering school in
France in telecommunications and networking. I was a Research Engineer
in the group lead by Ana Cavalli, which specialises in
<strong>specification-based testing of protocols</strong>. Of
particular interest is the language <a
 href="http://www.sdl-forum.org/SDL/index.htm">SDL</a>, based on
asynchronously communicating extended finite automata. I implemented,
with <a href="http://www.lri.fr/perso/~zaidi/">Fatiha Za&iuml;di</a>,
a tool producing test sequences for embedded components, by piloting a
commercial software (ObjectGeode) which was not designed for that
purpose. This research and development was published and was part of
two projects funded by the French government.</p>

<p>In 2000, I joined PolySpace Technologies (now part of <a
 href="http://www.mathworks.com/">The MathWorks</a>), as a Research
Engineer. I worked with Alain Deutsch, Arnaud Venet and Bruno Blanchet
to design and implement a <strong>static analyser</strong> for <a
 href="www.javacardforum.org/">JavaCard</a>, based on the theory of
abstract interpretation, pionneered by <a
 href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~cousot/">Prof. Patrick Cousot</a>. The
goal was to detect a whole range of run-time errors. I also took part
to the <strong>testing</strong> of the product targeting C.</p>

<p>In 2001, I left France to work at the <a
href="http://www.icu.ac.kr/">Information and Communication
University</a>, in Daejeon (South Korea), where, as a Research
Associate, I resumed unfinished work on ASN.1.</p>

<p>From 2003 to 2004, I was an Assistant Professor at <a
href="http://www.devinci.fr/">&Eacute;cole Sup&eacute;rieure
d'Ing&eacute;nieurs L&eacute;onard de Vinci</a>, a.k.a. ESILV
(Courbevoie, France), where I taught undergraduates and did some
research on a <strong>web-based framework supporting
e-learning</strong>, with <a
href="http://www.tfh-berlin.de/~merceron/">Prof. Agathe Merceron</a>
(who is an expert in data-mining). This is how, via <a
href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Cocoon</a> and <a
href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Forrest</a>, I came to be interested
in <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> and the related languages,
like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/">XSLT</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/">XQuery</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2005, I am an Assistant Professor
in <a href="http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/">Konkuk University</a> (Seoul,
South Korea), in
the <a href="http://im.konkuk.ac.kr/contents/sub13.php">Department of
Internet and Multimedia</a>, where I teach undergraduates. In 2006, I
resumed my M.Sc. topic, i.e., <strong>metacompilation</strong>, in
partnership with Nic Volanschi. The approach this time was to
<a href="http://mygcc.free.fr">extend a compiler (GCC)</a> with a new
kind of user-defined patterns,
called <a href="http://mypatterns.free.fr"><em>unparsed patterns</em></a>,
which are matched against the source code, e.g., for static debugging
purposes. I am also interested in the semantics of XSLT and the design
of a <strong>streaming compiler for XSLT</strong>,
and an implementation in OCaml
or <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, <a href="http://aldebaran.devinci.fr/~cagnol/">Prof. John
    Cagnol</a> and I initiated and developed a strategic alliance
    between ESILV and Konkuk University, which lead to the signature
    of a Memorandum of Understanding between the two universities,
    opening roads to student and professor interchanges, as well as
    common research projects.</p>

<p>
Since 2009, I have become interested in the <strong>didactics of
    programming</strong>, in particular, the learning and teaching
    of <em>recursion</em> in programming courses. I tutored Juan Diego
    Tasc&oacute;n Vidarte, a master student at Konkuk University, on
    the design and implementation of a tangible interface with
    augmented reality and feedback to help novices to learn recursive
    programming and functional programming. (See publications.)</p>

<h2>Snapshots</h2>

<h3>Didactics of Programming Languages</h3>

<p>Recursion is a powerful programming technique which is notoriously
difficult to master, especially in functional languages because they
prominently feature structural recursion as the main control-flow
mechanism. Juan Diego Tasc&oacute;n Vidarte and I propose several
hypotheses to understand the issue and put some to the test by
designing an open-source interactive interface based on a tangible
block-world with augmented reality and software feedback. Stacks of
blocks are used as an analogy for the list data structure, which
enables the simplest form of structural recursion. After using this
application, students are expected to transfer their training to
directly write recursive programs in sequential
<a href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a>, a <em>purely functional
language</em>.</p>

<p>I also worked alone on novel ways to introduce undergraduates to
  recursive programming, either by relying on functional languages
  and <em>logic</em> or the <em>analysis of algorithms</em>. I am
  currently working on a survey of the field of teaching and learning
  recursion. (See publications for the bibliography.)</p>

<h3>XML-related languages</h3>

<p>I am currently interested in XML technologies, from a
language/database/web perspective with tool implementation in mind. In
other words: semantics of XPath, XSLT, XQuery and the pair RDF/OWL
(semantic web); understanding the expressiveness of XML Schema, Relax
NG and Schematron as specifications enabling to check the correctness
of XML transformations or node selections; querying XML databases with
XQuery; frameworks for building and maintaining large web sites;
searching the semantic web. Practically, I focus mainly on creating
new algorithms or algorithms which are more efficient, as well as
implementing them into end-user tools.</p>

<h3>Metacompilation</h3>

<p>In 2007, I did some research with <a
   href="http://nic.volanschi.free.fr/">Dr Nic Volanschi</a> on
  metacompilation. Metacompilation consists in extending compilers or,
  more generally, parsing-based tools, with user-defined patterns to
  be matched against the source code. Our novel approach consists in
  <em>unparsed patterns</em>, a kind of pattern which does not require
  to be parsed, hence does not require the parser of the object
  language to be extended, thus rewritten, in order to cope with
  metavariables.</p>

<h3>Intelligent tutoring systems and authoring environments</h3>

<p>From 2003 to 2004, I have being involved with this topics. The
ambition was to understand what kinds of paradigms are relevant for
distant learning (some times called e-learning), and provide some
tools and a web plateform to annotate learning ressources, to index
them and assist the teachers by means of data mining.</p>

<h3>Formal design review</h3>

<p>Some commonly used languages or protocols have no formal design but
we trust them because they are widely deployed and discussed among
experts. Nevertheless, security issues are reaching a wider audience
than ever before and thus some formal design reviews are useful to
check in details whether we should really trust or not some
technology. It is not a matter of providing a full formalisation and
theorems, just doing some reasonable and formal works on the selected
topics.</p>

<h3>Semantics of formal languages (case study: ASN.1)</h3>

<p>Many languages are defined by means of international standards but
lack of formal foundations. This is the case of ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax
Notation One) which is a standard language for defining data types
whose values may be exchanged across a network between two
communicating applications, independently from the possible
heterogeneity of the peers. ASN.1 has been adopted by a wide range of
applications, such as network management, secure email, mobile
telephony, voice over IP etc. It offers a very involved subtyping
paradigm consisting of constraints upon recursive types, which
restrict their sets of values in a set-theoretic manner or in a
structural way. Because of this great expressiveness, most ASN.1
compilers are not likely to fully check arbitrary combinations of
subtyping constraints. We are interested in fully validate ASN.1
specifications and compile it by means of different theoretical
approaches, like <em>set constraints</em> and <em>structured
operational semantics</em>, a formalism usually employed in
programming languages theory.</p>

<h3>Test generation for telecommunication protocols</h3>

<p>Testing telecommunication protocols is important and
difficult. Here we mean protocol <em>specifications</em>, not the
software which implements it. These specifications can be expressed in
different formal languages, as SDL, LOTOS, Lustre etc., based on
different theoretical models (synchronous communication, finite state
machines etc.). I worked on SDL (Semantics Description Language)
specifications while aiming at <em>test generation</em>, especially
embedded testing. The problem is that it is impossible to explore all
the states of a specification (and then prove some invariant property)
because of the exponential number of states. Moreover, sometimes we
want to cover only a given part (module) of a specification which has
neither observation nor control points with the environment.</p>
