\paragraph{Question.} Design a simple data structure to represent
binary trees which hold integers at their leaves\footnote{A leaf is an
internal node whose both children are external nodes.} only. For
example:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{btree}
\end{center}
Write an efficient predicate \texttt{tmerge/2} such
that \texttt{tmerge(Tree,Nodes)} is provable if and only if
\texttt{Nodes} is the list of all the leaves of the tree \texttt{Tree}
in increasing order of their integer values. In the example
above, we have \texttt{Nodes=[1,5,7,9]}.
