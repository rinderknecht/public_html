\paragraph{Question.} Given a predicate \texttt{edge/2} encoding
a general tree containing information at all of its nodes, write a
predicate \texttt{depth\_first/2} such that
\texttt{depth\_first(Tree,Nodes)} is provable if and only if
\texttt{Nodes} is the list of all the nodes of the tree \texttt{Tree}
in depth-first order (in general, several are possible). For example,
given
\begin{verbatim}
edge(1,3).
edge(2,4).
edge(1,2).
edge(2,5).
edge(1,6).
\end{verbatim}
then \texttt{Nodes = [1,3,2,4,5,6]}.
