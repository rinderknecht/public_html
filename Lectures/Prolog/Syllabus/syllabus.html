<h3>Syllabus of Logic Programming in Prolog</h3>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<p>The goal of this course is to give an overview of a new programming
paradigm: programming by means of logic (also known as logic
programming). The language to illustrate it is Prolog. The simplicity
of first-order inference makes it a good candidate to explore this
field. The similarities between Prolog programming and querying
databases inductively, e.g., by means of Datalog, are mentioned. The
course is complemented by notes on the larger field of artificial
intelligence (AI), in particular abstract neural networks and their
application to pattern recognition and clustering.</p>

<h4>How to achieve the goals</h4>

<p>The complete slide presentation is already available at the <a
href="http://konkuk.ac.kr/~rinderkn/">author's web site</a>, so
students should read some slides in advance before attending the
corresponding class. This way, they also can get a clear meaning of
the language --- since this course is taught in English. Exercises
will be given during class in order to assess student's understanding
and for training purposes. Two quizzes will be formally given
too. Each time, the answers will be available from the author's web
site in a short delay.</p>


<h4>Textbook</h4>

<p>Many textbooks are available in English and Korean but this course
will be founded upon regular programming homeworks instead of
reading.</p>
