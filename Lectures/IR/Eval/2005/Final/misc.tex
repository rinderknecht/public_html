 \begin{enumerate}

    \item apply the subset construction to \({\cal N}_1\): this gives
      a DFA \({\cal D}_1\);

    \item rename the states of \({\cal D}_1\);

    \item reverse the edges of \({\cal D}_1\) and exchange initial and
      final states: this gives a NFA \({\cal N}_2\);

    \item apply the subset construction to \({\cal N}_2\), which gives
      a DFA \({\cal D}_2\);

    \item rename the states of \({\cal D}_2\);

    \item reverse the edges of \({\cal D}_2\) and exchange initial and
      final states: this gives the NFA \({\cal N}_3\). What do you
      think about \({\cal N}_3\)?
