Consider the queuing delay in a router buffer. Suppose all the packets
are \(L\) bits long, the transmission rate is \(R\) bit/sec and that
\(N\) packets arrive simultaneously at the buffer every
\(\frac{LN}{R}\) seconds.

\textbf{Question.} Find the \textbf{average} queuing delay of a
packet.

\textbf{Hint.} The queuing delay for the first packet is 0; for the
second packet it is \(\frac{L}{R}\); for the third packet it is
\(2{\frac{L}{R}}\) etc. The last packet (number \(N\)) has already
been transmitted when the second batch (i.e., group) of packets
arrives.
