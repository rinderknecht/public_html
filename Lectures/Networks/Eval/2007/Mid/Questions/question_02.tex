\textbf{Questions.} Consider the queuing delay in a router buffer. Let
\(I\) denote the traffic intensity, that is: \(I =
\frac{aL}{R}\). Suppose that the queuing delay takes the form
\(\frac{IL}{R(1-I)}\) for \(I < 1\).
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Provide a formula for the total delay, that is, the queuing
    delay plus the transmission delay.

  \item Express the total delay as a function \(d\) of
    \(\frac{L}{R}\), that is to say, define \(d(x) = \ldots\)

\end{enumerate}
