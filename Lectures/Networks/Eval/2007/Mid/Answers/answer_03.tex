\textbf{Answer.} Before any bit can be transmitted, all the bits in
the same packet must be gathered first. This requires
\[
  \frac{48 \times 8}{64 \times 10^3} \; \text{sec}~ =~6 \;
  \text{msec}
\]
The time required to transmit the packet is
\[
  \frac{48 \times 8}{1 \times 10^{6}} \; \text{sec}~=~0.384
  \; \text{msec}
\]
The propagation delay is 2~msec.

Therefore the delay between coding and decoding is
\begin{center}
  6~msec + 0.384~msec + 2~msec = 8.384~msec
\end{center}
