\textbf{Answer.}  It takes \(\frac{NL}{R}\) seconds to transmit the
\(N\) packets. Thus, the buffer is empty when a batch of \(N\) packets
arrive.

The first of the \(N\) packets has no queuing delay. The second packet
has a queuing delay of \(\frac{L}{R}\) seconds. The \(n\)-th packet
has a delay of \((n-1){\frac{L}{R}}\).

Therefore the average delay is \setlength\mathindent{-1pc}
\[
 {\frac{1}{N}}\sum_{n=1}^{N}(n-1){\frac{L}{R}} = \frac{L}{R}
 \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}n = \frac{L}{R} \frac{1}{N}
 \frac{(N-1)N}{2} = \frac{1}{2} (N-1) \frac{L}{R} 
\]
