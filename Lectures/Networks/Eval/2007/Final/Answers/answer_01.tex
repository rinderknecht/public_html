\begin{enumerate}

  \item The propagation delay of one bit is \(10^6/(2.5 \times 10^8) =
    4\) ms. We have \(R \times d_{\text{prop}} = 10^6 \times (4 \times
    10^{-3}) = 4,000\) bits.

  \item During the time equal to the propagation delay, the number of
    bits that have been pushed on the link, i.e., transmitted, is \(R
    \times d_{\text{prop}} = 10^6 \times (4 \times 10^{-3}) = 4,000\)
    bits.

  \item The bandwidth-delay product is the maximum number of bits on
    the link.

  \item Since there are 4,000 bits on the link at any time, the link,
    whose length is 1,000 km is shared by intervals of \(10^6/(4
    \times 10^3) = 0.25 \times 10^3 = 250\) meters.

\end{enumerate}
