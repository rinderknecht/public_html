\textbf{Answer.} A circuit\hyp{}switched network can guarantee a
certain amount of end\hyp{}to\hyp{}end bandwidth for the duration of
the call. Most packet\hyp{}switched networks today (including the
internet) cannot make any end\hyp{}to\hyp{}end guarantees for
bandwidth. In a circuit\hyp{}switched network using TDM, an
application can use the full bandwidth at periodical moments.
