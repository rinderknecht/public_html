\textbf{Questions.} \label{bandwidth_delay} Suppose two hosts \(A\)
and \(B\), separated by 1,000~km, and connected by a direct link of
\(R = 1\) Mbps. Propagation speed of the link is \(2.5 \times 10^8\)
m/sec.
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Calculate the \emph{bandwidth-delay product} \(R \times
    d_{\text{prop}}\).

  \item Consider sending a file of 400,000 bits from host \(A\) to
    host \(B\). Suppose the file is sent continuously as one big
    message. What is the maximum number of bits that we will be in the
    link at any given time?

  \item Provide an interpretation of the bandwith-delay product.

  \item What is the width (in meters) of a bit in the link?

\end{enumerate}
