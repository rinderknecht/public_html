\begin{enumerate}

  \item Suppose that we have a circuit-switched network where
    \begin{itemize}

      \item users share a 1 Mbps link;

      \item each user alternates periods of activity and of inactivity:
        \begin{itemize}

          \item when he is active, he generates data at the constant
            rate of 100~Kbps;

          \item when he is idle, he produces no data.

        \end{itemize}

      \item each user is active during 10\% of the time.

    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Question:} How many users can the link support?

  \item \label{message_switching} Consider a message of size \(7.5
    \cdot 10^6\) bits, three links of rate 1.5 Mbps connecting two
    hosts (i.e., there are two switches in-between them) and assume
    that there is no congestion and no delay at the switches.

    \textbf{Question:} How much time is required to send and receive
    the message?

  \item The situation is as in case~\ref{message_switching} but now
    the message is broken into two packets of equal size. 

    \textbf{Question:} Assuming that only one packet can travel a link
    at a time, how much time is required to send and receive the
    message?


\end{enumerate}
