Consider sending a large file of \(F\) bits from host \(A\) to host
\(B\). There are two links (and one switch) between them and the links
are uncongested (that is, no queuing delays). Host \(A\) segments the
file into segments of \(S\) bits each and adds \(h\) bits of header to
each segment, forming packets of \(L = h + S\) bits. Each link has a
transmission rate of \(R\) bit/s. Assuming that \(F/S\) is an integer,
find the value of \(S\) that minimises the delay of moving the file
from host \(A\) to host \(B\). Disregard propagation delay.
