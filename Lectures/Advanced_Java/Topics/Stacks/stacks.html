<h2>Stacks</h2>

<p>Stacks are perhaps the simplest data structures featuring dynamic
memory allocation. During the first class on the subject, we saw two
designs for <em>imperative programming</em>, where data are updated
destructively (from the point of view of the data structure, they are
called <em>ephemeral</em>). An advantage of this style is a reduced
memory footprint, a disadvantage is that great care must be paid to
the order of the updates to avoid conflicting read-write and
write-write operations. This is of particular importance when such
data structures are shared between threads.</p>

<p>We also discussed partial and total functions and two ways to
implement the former: either by using exceptions, or declaring
dedicated classes to provide the interpretations "result available"
and "result not available", sometimes called and <em>optional
value</em> or a <em>Maybe</em>. The technique based on exceptions
allows the function to retain its natural return type, but
requires <tt>try/catch</tt> blocks at the call sites; the second one
requires a new return type and testing the return value (and the use
of generics).</p>

<p>We started hinting at the uses and misuses of the <tt>null</tt>
reference. Here are some publications and a talk to broaden your
mind.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good presentation of the issues involved but the presence
  of <tt>null</tt> in Java and optional values is found in the first
  30 pages of the following
  PhD: <a href="much_ado_about_nothing__Putting_Java_s_null_in_its_place--2008.pdf">Much
  Ado about Nothing: Putting Java's null in its place (2008)</a>.</li>

 <li>The
 paper <a href="non-null_references_by_default_in_Java--2006.pdf">Non-null
 references by default in Java (2006)</a> is a proposal based
 on <em>annotations</em>.</li>

 <li>The talk
 entitled <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">Null
 references: The Billion Dollar Mistake (2009)</a> by the famous
 British scholar Tony Hoare is worth watching.

<h3>Persistent Stacks (<em>functional style</em>)</h3>

<p>One solution to avoid <tt>null</tt> dereferencing is to
use <em>persistence</em>, which is the property of a value to remain
constant. In particular, it enables to compose methods
safely. Persistence enables <em>version control</em> (historical
recording) by simply storing all versions of the data structure and
ensuring maximum sharing between two successive versions. This sharing
is always safe because values are constants. This property is
naturally also very useful in the context of concurrent programming,
where sharing is performed between different threads of execution. It
is also pervasive within <em>functional programming languages</em>,
for example Erlang. Here is our design pattern, which is similar to
the one proposed in the
article <a href="teaching_linked_lists_and_recursion_without_conditionals_or_null--2003.pdf">Teaching
linked lists and recursion without conditionals or null
(2003)</a>.</p>

</ol>


<h3>Ephemeral Stacks (<em>imperative style</em>)</h3>

<p>When thread safety is not an issue, when memory usage is a concern,
when it is not important to keep a history of a data structure, the
implementation of the stack had better be <em>ephemeral</em> and rely
on side-effects, which is the mainstay of imperative programming
languages. Our design consists in publishing a class <tt>Stack</tt>,
which relies for on a class <tt>Cell</tt> which serves as the
container of the keys in the stack (if any). The reason for this
two-tiered design appears when we try the design commonly used in the
C programming language, that is, if we try to encode the empty stack
with the (infamous) <tt>null</tt> reference and a non-empty stack with
an instance of <tt>Stack</tt>: not only this usage of <tt>null</tt>
has been shown above as dangerous, but it is not possible to modify
the <tt>this</tt> reference in Java (it is implicitly final),
preventing the tranformation of a non-empty stack into an empty
one. Furthermore, for the sake of contrasting as much as possible
ephemeral and persistent stacks, we do not use recursion and rely
exclusively on loops. Here are the Java files:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="Ephemeral/Stack.java">Class for stacks</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Ephemeral/Cell.java">Container for a key</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Ephemeral/EphObj.java">Main class</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note the use of <em>sentinels</em>, in this case dummy nodes, which
make the code shorter by eliminating redundancy.</p>

<p>As far as <tt>merge</tt> is concerned, note the similarities
with <tt>isort</tt>, revealing that merging consists in the insertion
of increasing values into an increasingly sorted stack, without
restarting the search for the insertion position at the head each
time. Moreover, <tt>merge_opt</tt> is an optimisation where the
longest prefix of one stack is inserted: the code is actually a bit
shorter then that of <tt>merge</tt> because we simply exchange the
role of the two stacks! Merge sort relies on <tt>merge</tt>
and <tt>split</tt>, which splits a stack in two halves, without
knowing in advance its length. This is achieved by a trick consisting
in moving a reference one at a time in the stack and another two cells
at a time in the same stack: when the latter cannot move further, the
former has reached the middle (more precisely, the insertion point is
after the current it refers to). This is more efficient than counting
the number of cells and then revisiting the first half, and also it is
safer, as no arithmetic overflow can occur. Merge sort is a typical
example of the <em>divide and conquer</em> strategy: the input is
split, each non-trivial part is recursively processed and the partial
solutions are finally combined to form the complete solution.</p>
