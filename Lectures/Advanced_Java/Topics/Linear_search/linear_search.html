<h2>Linear search in arrays</h2>

<p>Linear search is a basic technique to search for an item in an
 array, where the items in the array is compared to the sought item
 until it is found or all have been examined. The choice of the items
 for comparison is by increasing indices from the start of the array,
 or by decreasing indices from the end, hence drawing an imaginary
 line as in "linear search".</p>
 
<p>The implementation in Java of this algorithm allows us to review
several basic concepts and techniques: empty arrays, index ranges,
sequential boolean operators, loops, recursion, sentinels, assertions,
loop invariants and termination. This example suggests
different <em>test cases</em>: the empty array, the singleton array
and the large array. Moreover, the stylistic issues covered are:
uniformity of access to array items, the <tt>++</tt> operators, the
separation of read and writes (side-effects) in expressions.</p>

          analyses of self-organizing sequential search heuristics
          (1985)</a> which analyses the costs of two common heuristics
          whose aim is to improve on linear search.
