(* This module implements A* search, following Hart, Nilsson,
   and Raphael (1968).

   To each visited graph node, the algorithm associates an
   internal record, carrying various information. For this
   reason, the algorithm's space complexity is, in the worst
   case, linear in the size of the graph.

   The mapping of nodes to internal records is implemented
   via a hash table, while the converse mapping is direct
   (via a record field).

   Nodes that remain to be examined are kept in a priority
   queue, where the priority of a node is the cost of the
   shortest known path from the start node to it plus the
   estimated cost of a path from this node to a goal node.
   (Lower priority nodes are considered first).

   It is the use of the second summand that makes A* more
   efficient than Dijkstra's standard algorithm for finding
   shortest paths in an arbitrary graph. In fact, when
   [G.estimate] is the constant zero function, A* coincides
   with Dijkstra's algorithm. One should note that A* is
   faster than Dijkstra's algorithm only when a path to some
   goal node exists. Otherwise, both algorithms explore the
   entire graph, and have similar time requirements.

   The priority queue is implemented as an array of doubly
   linked lists. *)
