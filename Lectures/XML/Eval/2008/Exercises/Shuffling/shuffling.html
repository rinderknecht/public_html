<h2>Shuffling Sequences</h2>

<p><strong>Aim.</strong> The purpose of this exercise is to write an
XSLT transform which takes as input two sequences of elements and
output one sequence containing the items of each sequence shuffled,
i.e., the first item of the first sequence comes out first, the first
item of the second sequence comes out second, the second item of the
first sequence comes out third, the second item of the second sequence
comes out fourth etc. A useful analogy is shuffling a deck of cards
with two hands.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1.</strong> The problem is actually
underspecified: nothing is said about what to do if the two sequences
are not of the same length. Let us assume first that they are of the
same length, in which case this is called a <em>perfect
shuffle</em>. If the first items of both sequences are taken out
<em>at the same time</em>, then comes a moment when either both
sequences are empty or only one of them is. In the latter case, a
perfect shuffle ignores the dangling items.</p>

<strong>Examples 1.</strong> The perfect shuffle
transforms
<ul>
  <li> <a href="./persons1.xml">this</a> input
  into <a href="./shuffle1_1.xml">that</a> output;</li>
  <li> <a href="./persons2.xml">this</a> input
  into <a href="./shuffle2_1.xml">that</a> output;</li>
  <li> <a href="./persons3.xml">this</a> input
  into <a href="./shuffle3_1.xml">that</a> output.</li>
</ul>
You need to download the <a href="./persons.dtd">DTD</a> to run these
examples.

<p><strong>Answer 1.</strong> Consider this <a
   href="./shuffle1.xsl">solution</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Question 2.</strong> The second possibility, when
  confronted to dangling items is to append them to the already
  outputted items.</p>

<strong>Examples 2.</strong> The second method transforms
<ul>
  <li> <a href="./persons1.xml">this</a> input
  into <a href="./shuffle1_2.xml">that</a> output;</li>
  <li> <a href="./persons2.xml">this</a> input
  into <a href="./shuffle2_2.xml">that</a> output;</li>
  <li> <a href="./persons3.xml">this</a> input
  into <a href="./shuffle3_2.xml">that</a> output.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Answers 2.</strong> Consider this <a
   href="./shuffle2.xsl">solution</a> which extracts two items at a
  time and <a href="./shuffle3.xsl">this other one</a> which extracts
  only one item at each call</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Question 3 (Threesome Shuffling).</strong> Write a
  shuffling that operates on <em>three</em> sequences,
  like <a href="./shuffle4.xml">this input</a>. The order of shuffling
  is 3-1-2, i.e., first, pick the first element of the third sequence;
  second, pick the first element of the first sequence; third, pick
  the first element of the second sequence. When trying to pick up and
  element on an empty sequence, skip to the next sequence until all
  the sequences are empty. The result with the previous input
  is <a href="./shuffle4_out.xml">this output</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Answer 3.</strong> <a href="./shuffle4.xsl">This</a> is a
solution.</p>
