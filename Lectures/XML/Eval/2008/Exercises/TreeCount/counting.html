<h2>Counting Sections in a Table of Contents</h2>

<p><strong>Question.</strong> The purpose of this exercise is to write
  an XSLT transform which takes as input a table of contents and
  computes the number of sections (only).
</p>

<p><strong>Example.</strong> <a href="./toc.xml">This</a> is an
  example of input document and <a href="./count1.txt">this</a> is the
  corresponding output. You need to fetch
  the <a href="./book.dtd">DTD</a> corresponding to run this example.
</p>

<strong>Hints.</strong>
<ul>

  <li> The idea is to match the root element, then select the first
  level of sections, just below the chapters. This sequence of section
  nodes is passed to a template named <tt>count</tt>, whose job is to
  count all the sections in it. If this sequence of sections is empty,
  the answer is <tt>0</tt>. Otherwise,
  <ol>

    <li> we call recursively <tt>count</tt> on the subsections of the
    first section;</li>

    <li> this number plus one is the number of sections in the first
    section (including itself) of the sequence;</li>

    <li> finally call recursively <tt>count</tt> on the rest of the
    sequence (i.e., the remaining sections) and add this number to the
    previous one: the total is the result.</li>

  </ol></li>

  <li> Note that the two recursive calls can be interchanged. In the
  former case (first call on the children of the first node, second
  call on the following siblings), the tree traversal
  is <em>depth-first</em>.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Answers.</strong>
<ul>

  <li> The following solution is based on a <a href="./count1.xsl">
  depth-first traversal</a>, that is, children are visited before
  siblings.</li>

  <li> The following transform visits
  the <a href="./count2.xsl">siblings before the children</a>.</li>

  <li> <a href="./count3.xsl">This</a> solution is based on a
  depth-first traversal with an extra-parameter for the current number
  of sections already visited (this is an <em>accumulator</e>). Note
  how the case of the empty sequence yields the current count instead
  of <tt>0</tt>, as opposed to previous versions.</li>

  <li> <a href="./count4.xsl">This</a> transform is the same as the
  previous one but the variable <tt>subsec</tt> is eliminated by
  expansion in the second recursive call. Note the use of
  a <em>default value</em> for parameter <tt>current</tt>, thus
  avoiding to initialise it in the first call (in the template
  matching element <tt>book</tt>).</li>

</ul>
