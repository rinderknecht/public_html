The purpose is, given an \textsf{XML} document representing a book
made of chapters and sections (whose titles are specified as
attributes), to write an \textsf{XSL} transform that extracts the
table of contents, followed by the original document where all
attributes are changed into elements. For example, from the document
\XMLin{book.xml}

\newpage

\noindent we want the output
\saxonCut{tmp.xml}{book}{print}
