This time it is about shuffling three stacks of cards in the following
way (the top of the stacks is on the top of the figure):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{>{$}c<{$}>{$}c<{$}>{$}c<{$}c>{$}c<{$}}
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & \multirow{4}{*}{\(\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow\)}
  & a_3\\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3 & & a_1\\
c_1 & c_2 &     & & a_2\\
    & d_2 &     & & b_3\\
    &     &     & & b_1\\
    &     &     & & b_2\\
    &     &     & & c_1\\
    &     &     & & c_2\\
    &     &     & & d_2
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
If the three stacks are empty, then the result is empty too.

\bigskip

\noindent The empty stack is noted as usual \proc{Empty} and the stack
\(S\) with item \(e\) on the top is noted \(\proc{Push}(e,S)\).

\bigskip

\paragraph{Question.} Define \(\proc{TSS}(S_1, S_2, S_3)\) as
rewriting to the shuffling.
