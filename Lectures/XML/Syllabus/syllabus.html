<h3>Syllabus of the XML/XSLT course</h3>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>The goal of this course is to present <b>XML</b> (<i>eXtensible
Markup Language</i>) as well as some related standards, in particular
<b>DTD</b> (<i>Document Type Definition</i>), <b>XPath</b> (<i>XML
Path</i>) and <b>XSLT</b> (<i>eXtensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations</i>), which are commonly used in web sites and
document-processing software chains. These languages are formal
languages standardised by the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">W3
Consortium</a>. The tool used in class and for the homeworks is the
open source XSLT/XQuery processor <a
href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxon</a>.</p>

<h4>Plan</h4>

<ol>
  <li>First introduction of XML as a formal language for modelling
    structured multimedia documents independently of any text layout
    or media players. This specification is then shown to
    syntactically correspond to the concept of annotated, unranked
    trees, where elements (sections, in the document-oriented view)
    are trees and sub-elements (subsections) subtrees. Attributes are
    special subtrees. Element nodes can be repeated among
    siblings. Example of modelling an email.</li>

  <li>Escaped characters and the rationale for them are
    explained. Entities of all kinds (predefined and named,
    user-defined internal, external), document type declarations,
    unparsed character data, comments and namespaces are
    presented. In particular, the interaction between namespaces and
    attributes is insisted upon, as well as the interaction between
    embedded namespaces.</li>

  <li>Internal linking is introduced, in order to model hypertext
    linking (which does not fit in the finite tree model). Processing
    instructions are introduced.</li>

  <li>The concept of well-formedness is shown to be important as a
    minimum level of confidence in the model.</li>

  <li>XHTML is presented as a derivative of XML. The rationale behind
    its design is given and the differences with HTML are insisted
    upon. Global structure, headings, lists (ordered, unordered and
    definitions), tables are extensively discussed on examples because
    XHTML is going to be used as the output of some future XSL
    transforms.</li>

  <li>The Document Type Declaration (<b>DTD</b>) allows to restrict
    the set of trees (document) an application processes, by
    specifying exhaustively all the kinds of nodes and their
    attributes. It enables a more powerful form of well-formedness
    checking than just checking the XML syntax of the document. This
    is the <strong>validation</strong> concept. In particular,
    attribute lists, all kinds of element declarations are presented
    in detail as a validation support. The meaning of external and
    external subsets of a DTD is explained. The well-formedness and
    validity of XML files will be checked using a tool named
    <i>xmllint</i>. The XSLT will be applied using the tool named
    <i>Saxon</i>.</li>

  <li>The next step is to understand how to rewrite an XML document
    into another text, possibly XML. This can be achieved by use of
    <b>XSLT</b>. The difficult part is that this language is
    declarative, i.e., it does not provide notions such as loops or
    mutable variables (i.e. variables whose contents can change). For
    most students, XSLT is the first functional language they meet in
    their curriculum, so special care is devoted to explaining the
    most puzzling aspects of XSLT, like the absence of mutable
    variables and loops. Instead the concept of recursive processing,
    by means of templates, is presented as a powerful
    alternative.</li>

  <li> Mid-term examination</li>

  <li>Starting with the non-obvious example of the empty XSL
    transform, the unusual computational model of XSLT (default
    behaviour for templates) is made apparent. The concept of template
    matching is explained as a mechanism of control. The application
    of several templates and their possible interaction is exemplified
    extensively.</li>

  <li>The selection of nodes inside a matching template is the first
    glimpse at <b>XPath</b> the students get. More standard XSLT
    elements are introduced, in particular the ubiquitous
    <tt>value-of</tt>. First transforms from XML data to
    XHTML. Example of a table of contents. The importance of
    validating the output, so to have valid XHTML displayed in a
    browser, is stressed. </li>

  <li>The difference between the root element and the document root is
    explained. Variables are immutable. Conditionals. Template
    parameters.</li>

  <li>Performing preorder traversal on the document (a table of
    contents) and numbering the entries. Selection of nodes revisited
    and extended to selection of attributes. Wildcards in XPath,
    location paths, predicates are explained in their basic instances
    (e.g., position among a sequence of nodes). Inserting elements in
    the output.</li>
  
  <li>Insertion of attributes in the resulting tree. Copying
    elements. The classic copy stylesheet is presented and
    recommended, in conjunction with the importation of
    stylesheets (which enables its usage).</li>

  <li>Functions are presented and their differences with named
  templates is insisted upon (with respect to XPath, i.e., selection
  of elements and attributes).</li>

  <li>Modal templates. Recursion is revisited.</li>

<li>Final examination</li>
