\paragraph{Question.} Write a function \texttt{merge/2} which takes
two lists of items increasingly sorted by \verb|<| and returns a new
sorted list containing the items of both inputs. For instance 
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
> final:merge([3,5,8,8,10,12],[1,2,5,6,7,9,11]).
[1,2,3,5,5,6,7,8,8,9,10,11,12]
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent Make two versions: (1) one not tail recursive, (2) one tail
recursive.
