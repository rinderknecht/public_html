\paragraph{Answer.}

The trap here is the empty tree. The sum of the nodes of an empty tree
ought to be undefined. But, when following recursively the
branches of tree, if we encounter the empty tree, then it can be an
acceptable situation, since it means that the parent is actually a
leaf of the original tree. One way to handle the empty tree in these
two different contexts consists in writing no clause for the empty
tree and use an auxiliary function, \emph{which is not exported} and
which handles the empty tree in the recursion. Another technique
consists in never accepting the empty tree and stop at the leaves.
