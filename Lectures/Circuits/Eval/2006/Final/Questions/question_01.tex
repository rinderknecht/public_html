\paragraph{Questions.}
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Let be an \(n\)-bit binary number. How many numbers can it
    encode? What is the lowest? What is the highest? (Prove it.) 

  \item Same questions if the binary number is interpreted as a
    \(2\)-complement.

  \item When is the number \(d_{n-1} \times 10^{n-1} + d_{n-2} \times
    10^{n-2} + \dots + d_1 \times 10 + d_0\) interpreted as the
    decimal number whose digits are \(d_{n-1}d_{n-2} \dots d_0\)?

  \item Prove that, in order to convert a binary number into an octal
    number, one groups the bits three by three from right to left and
    then convert each group into decimal, without worrying about
    carries.

  \item Why is the multiplication of binary numbers easy?

  \item Consider an \(n\)-bit \(2\)-complement binary number. If the
    leftmost bit is \(1\), then the number is negative, whilst if it
    is \(0\), then the number is positive or nul. Why?

  \item Can the negation of an \(n\)-bit \(2\)-complement binary
    number fail?

  \item For all bits \(x\) and \(y\), the boolean function \(F\) is
    partially defined as
\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c||c}
  A & B & C & D & F\\
\hline
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
  0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
  1 & 1 & x & y & 0\\
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
  1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\]
Find both the simplified sum of products and product of sums of \(F\).

\end{enumerate}
