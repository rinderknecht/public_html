\paragraph{Answer.} For the sake of simplicity, we assume \(AB
= BA\) and \(A+B=B+A\). There are several possible answers.
\[
A + AB \myeq{6} A \cdot 1 + AB \myeq{2} A(1 + B) \myeq{3} A \cdot 1
\myeq{6} A
\]
\noindent Note: equation \(2\) is used after replacing \(C\) by \(1\).
\[
A(A+B) \myeq{5} (A + 0)(A+B) \myeq{1} A + 0 \cdot B \myeq{4} A + 0 \myeq{5} A
\]
\noindent Note: equation \(3\) is used after replacing \(C\) by \(0\). Or,
assuming \(\myeq{12}\):
\[
A(A+B) \myeq{2} A \cdot A + AB \myeq{8} A + AB \myeq{12} A
\]
\noindent Note: equation \(2\) is used after replacing \(C\) by \(A\).
