\paragraph{Question.} Write an \textbf{efficient} C function
  which converts from ternary to decimal. The prototype is
\begin{verbatim}
int from3to10 (int* ternary, int t_size);
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{ternary} is an array of integers, of size
\texttt{t\_size}, representing a number in base \(3\). The most
significant digit (also known as \emph{trit}) is the first element of
array \texttt{ternary}.
