\paragraph{Answer.} Let us consider a number \(N\) whose
\(n\)\hyp{}trits representation is \[1 t_{n-2} t_{n-3}\dots t_0\] in
balanced ternary (\(t_i \in \{\overline{1}, 0, 1\}\)). By definition,
this means that \(N = 3^{n-1} + t_{n-2} 3^{n-2} + \dots + t_0\). In
order to prove that \(0 < N\), let us take the lowest possible value
of \(N\) and show it is indeed positive. This value
\(N_{\textit{min}}\) is defined by taking all the remaining
unspecified trits to be \(\overline{1}\), that is
\begin{align*}
  N_{\textit{min}} &= 3^{n-1} - 3^{n-2} - \dots - 1\\
               &= 3^{n-1} - (3^{n-2} + \dots + 1)\\
               &= 3^{n-1} - S(3,n-1)\\
               &= 3^{n-1} - (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\\
               &= (3^{n-1} + 1)/2
\end{align*}
So \(0 < N_{\textit{min}}\), and thus so is \(N\).

Let us suppose now that \(N\) has a balanced ternary representation of
the shape \(\overline{1} t_{n-2} t_{n-3}\dots t_0\). By definition,
this means that \(N = -3^{n-1} + t_{n-2} 3^{n-2} + \dots + t_0\). In
order to prove that \(N < 0\), let us take the greatest possible value
of \(N\) and show it is indeed negative. This value
\(N_{\textit{max}}\) is defined by taking all the remaining
unspecified trits to be \(1\), that is \(N_{\textit{max}} =
\overline{1}11\dots1 =
\overline{1\overline{11\dots1}} =
\overline{N_{\textit{min}}} = - N_{\textit{min}} < 0\). (Complementing
the trits is the same as negating the number.) So \(N < 0\).
