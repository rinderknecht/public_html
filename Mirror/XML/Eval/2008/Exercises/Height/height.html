<h2>Height of a Table of Contents</h2>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to write an XSLT transform which
takes as input a table of contents and outputs its <em>height</em>,
which is, by definition, the maximum height of its chapters.
</p>

<ol>

  <li>The height of a table of contents is the maximum height of its
  chapters.</li>

  <li>The height of a chapter (respectively, section) is 1 plus the
  maximum height of its sections (respectively, subsections).</li>

  <li>The height of an empty sequence is 0.</li>

</ol>

<p>For instance, a book with no chapters has height 0 (it is empty). A
  book made only of chapters with no sections at all has height 1 (it
  is flat).
</p>

<p><strong>Example.</strong>
<a href="./toc.xml">This</a> is an example of input document and the
corresponding output is <a href="./height1.txt">this</a>. You need to
download this <a href="./book.dtd">DTD</a> to run this example.
</p>

<p><strong>Question 1.</strong> The above definition leads naturally
to a parallel implementation, since the height of the chapters and
sections can be computed separately. Write the transform <em>using
matching templates only</em>.
</p>

<strong>Hints.</strong>
<ul>

  <li>The output is text, so you need to set the
  attribute <tt>method="text"</tt>.</li>
   
  <li>Follow closely the definition above and reuse the template
  named <a href="../Maximum/max1.xsl"><tt>max</tt></a> which computes
  the maximum integer number in a sequence</li>

  <li>When you have two sequences of items (i.e., nodes, integer,
  strings, floats etc.), say <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt>, the sequence
  obtained by joining <tt>$b</tt> at the end of <tt>$a</tt> is
  noted <tt>($a,$b)</tt>. The joining of two sequences is often
  called <em>catenation</em> or <em>concatenation</em>.</li>

  <li>Use <tt>xsl:sequence</tt> to denote the heights.</li>

  <li>Supply the smaller type you can for all your variables and
  parameters, e.g., <tt>as="xs:integer"</tt> for heights. The type of a
  sequence of integers is <tt>xs:integer*</tt>.</li>

</ul>

<!-- <p><strong>Answer 1.</strong> -->
<!-- <a href="./height1.xsl">This</a> is one solution. Note how -->
<!-- the <tt>as</tt> attribute in <tt>&lt;xsl:with-param name="int" -->
<!-- as="xs:integer*"></tt> is <em>mandatory</em> when the -->
<!-- attribute <tt>select</tt> is not used. This way, the construction of -->
<!-- an of a document root is avoided and there is no type mismatch. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<hr/>

<p><strong>Question 2.</strong> Same question but this time, instead
  of computing in parallel de heights of the children of a given node,
  compute sequentially with a named template. The purpose is to avoid
  computing a sequence of heights and then taking their maximum. Two
  parameters are needed: a <tt>cur</tt> parameter which represents the
  height of the sequence so far (initial value is&nbsp;0)
  and <tt>seq</tt> holds the rest of the sequence whose height we want
  to know. (1)&nbsp;we compute the height of the sequence of the
  children of <tt>$seq[1]</tt>; (2)&nbsp;we add 1 to obtain the height
  of <tt>$seq[1]</tt>; (3)&nbsp;the maximum of this value
  and <tt>$cur</tt> is the value of <tt>cur</tt> in the recursive call
  on <tt>$seq[position()>1]</tt>. If <tt>$seq</tt> is empty, the
  maximum height of the nodes is <tt>$cur</tt>. (This scheme is
  similar to Counting the Number of Sections.)
</p>

<p><strong>Example.</strong>
<a href="./toc.xml">This</a> is an example of input document and the
corresponding output is <a href="./height2.txt">this</a> (it should be
the same value as before). You need to download
this <a href="./book.dtd">DTD</a> to run this example.
</p>

<p><strong>Answer 2.</strong> <a href="./height2.xsl">This</a> is a
simple solution to the problem.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Question 3.</strong> In the previous question, the height
  is computed <em>bottom-up</em>, that is, the increments on the
  height are performed just before the recursive calls end and new
  calls initialise the height parameter to 0. Propose a design where
  the height is incremented <em>top-down</em>, that is, the height
  parameter is added 1 in the recursive calls.</p>

simple solution to the problem.</p>
