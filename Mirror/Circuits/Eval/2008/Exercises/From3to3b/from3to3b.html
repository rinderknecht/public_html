<h2>Converting from ternary to balanced ternary</h2>

<p><strong>Question.</strong> The purpose of this exercise is to write
  a C program which reads on the command-line a string representing an
  integer in ternary form and outputs its corresponding balanced
  ternary representation.
</p>

<strong>Hints and constraints.</strong>
<ul>

  <li>The input must be checked in the <tt>main</tt> function, before
  the computation takes place, in the <tt>from3to3b</tt> function. In
  particular, be aware of invalid characters. (The empty string is not
  possible since the input is given on the command line.) Also, in
  order to find the number of significant trits, the leftmost zeros
  must be discarded.</li>

  <li>The signature of <tt>from3to3b</tt> must be <tt>char*
  from3to3b(const char ter[], unsigned int i)</tt>, where
  <tt>ter</tt> is the ternary string and <tt>i</tt> is the length
  of <tt>ter</tt>. The length is computed in <tt>main</tt>, when
  checking the input string, and it is useful in
  <tt>from3to3b</tt> to know the number of trits, thus how to allocate
  the output string.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Answer.</strong> The
following <a href="./from3to3b.c">file</a> is a possible answer. Note
the technique for finding the length of the balanced ternary
representation by scanning the trits from left to right.</p>
