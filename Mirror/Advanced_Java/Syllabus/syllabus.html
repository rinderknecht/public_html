<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>The aim of this course is to refresh knowledge and skills in Java
  programming, and to improve them so other courses requiring the
  implementation of distributed services is eased.</p>

<p>Beyond textbook algorithms, we will work on text and tree
processing, in other words, parsing text files, building an abstract
representation of its contents, called an <em>abstract syntax
tree</em>, and either transforming it to text or another tree, or
evaluating it. To implement these ideas, we will use the programming
languages Java, as well as tools like Lex and JavaCC. Along the way,
we will discuss algorithms and data structures, and we will insist on
different programming styles (procedural, object-oriented, functional,
recursive) to enhance the programmers' versatility. Sometimes, we may
also consider concurrency in conjunction with recursion and
immutability.</p>

<p>This choice of topic has been guided by the importance of practical
applications in the framework of the EIT ICT Labs master course. We
want to empower the students with concepts and tools to solve
technical challenges. Software engineers often have to process
formatted text files and that is why we decided on parsing as the
Ariadne's thread for this course.</p>
