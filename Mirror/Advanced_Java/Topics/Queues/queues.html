<h2>Queues</h2>

<p>Queues are, with stacks, the other linear data structure commonly
used by programmers. The difference between a queue and a stack is
that keys are pushed on a queue at the opposite end where they are
popped. Pushing in this case is called <em>enqueueing</em> and popping
is called <em>dequeueing</em>. Consequently, as far as data fields are
concerned, the class modelling queues contains two references: one on
the last enqueued object (on <em>the rear</em>), and one on the first
object to be dequeued (on <em>the front</em>). (Note that these
references must either be both non-null or null.) Having two
references instead of one, as with stacks, enables constant time
enqueueing <em>and</em> dequeueing.</p>

<h3>Persistent Queues (<em>functional style</em>)</h3>

<p>We follow the same design pattern as with the persistent stacks,
that is, we have an abstract class <tt>Queue</tt> from which two final
classes are derived: one for the empty queues (<tt>EQueue</tt>) and
one for the non-empty queues (<tt>NQueue</tt>). Note that we implement
both <tt>enqueue</tt> and <tt>dequeue</tt>, and the latter being
partial, throws the exception <tt>QEmpty</tt>.</p>

<p>The technique to implement non-empty queues consists in have a pair
of stacks, one to dequeue from, called the <em>front queue</em>, and
one to enqueue to, called the <em>rear stack</em>. A description of
this implementation and its amortised cost can be found in my
article <a href="http://pnyf.inf.elte.hu/rinderkn/pub/ie2011.pdf">A
Didactic Analysis of Functional Queues</a>. The Java classes are as
follows.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="Persistent/Queue.java">Abstract class for
  queues</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/EQueue.java">Empty queues</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/NQueue.java">Non-empty queues</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/QEmpty.java">Exception for dequeue</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/FunObj.java">Main class</a>.</li>
</ol>
Note that we need to redefine classes for persistent stacks as well, in order to support <em>dequeue</em>:
<ol>
  <li><a href="Persistent/Stack.java">Abstract class for
  stacks</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/EStack.java">Empty stacks</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/NStack.java">Non-empty stacks</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ephemeral Queues (<em>imperative style</em>)</h3>

<p>Here are the Java files containing the definition of a queue for
imperative programming, and some basic methods, either using loops
exclusively, or recursion only.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="Ephemeral/Queue.java">Class for queues</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Ephemeral/Cell.java">Container for a key</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Ephemeral/EphObj.java">Main class</a>.</li>
</ol>
