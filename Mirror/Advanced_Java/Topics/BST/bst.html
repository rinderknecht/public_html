<h2>Binary Search Trees</h2>

<p>Binary trees can be thought as an extension of a stack where there
two tails instead of one. The vocabulary is different, though. The
nomenclature we use consists in calling <em>internal nodes</em> the
nodes containing some information (equivalent to a non-empty stack),
and <em>external nodes</em> those without (equivalent to an empty
stack). The first node in a non-empty binary tree is called
the <em>root</em>, and an internal node whose two subtrees are
external nodes is called a <em>leaf</em>.</p>

<p>Binary search trees are a special kind of binary trees, where the
data stored in the internal nodes is totally ordered such that, for
any internal node, all the data in its left subtree is smaller and all
the data in its right subtree is larger. This constraint enables a
faster search than an exhaustive search through all the nodes in the
tree (equivalent to linear search in stacks). Indeed, if the sought
key is smaller than the key at the current node, it can only be
present in the left subtree, or absent from the tree. Similarly, if
the key we are looking for is greater than the current key, it can
only be present in the right subtree, or be absent. If we reach an
external node, we know that the key we sought is not present in the
binary search tree and, if we are lucky, we did not have to traverse
the whole tree to figure this out. Of course, it may be that the tree
is <em>degenerate</em>, that is, it is topologically equivalent to a
stack, in which case we hit the worst case because the search degrades
into a linear search. Fortunately, it can be shown that, for large
collections of keys, the set of possible binary search trees have
roughly balanced shaped (although not of logarithmic height), and
pathological cases are rare.</p>

<h3>Persistent Trees (<em>functional style</em>)</h3>

<p>Following the same design pattern as for persistent stacks, we obtain the following Java classes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="Persistent/BST.java">Abstract class for Binary Search Trees</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/Ext.java">Empty trees (external nodes)</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/Int.java">Non-empty trees (internal nodes)</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/Found.java">Exception when a key is
  found</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="Persistent/FunObj.java">Main class</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The method <tt>add</tt> does not allow for duplicates in the
tree. Moreover, it is optimised so that sharing is maximum in case of
an attempt at inserting a duplicate key (using an exception in the
auxiliary method <tt>add_aux</tt>). Remember the pattern in designing
this kind of code: <em>going down</em> refers to recursive calls, at
least on one of the subtrees, and <em>going up</em> refers to what is
done with the values of these completed recursive calls (for
example, <tt>mem</tt> does nothing but passing "up" the boolean,
whilst <tt>add</tt> reconstructs the path from the root to the leaf
where the insertion is performed).</p>

<p>We designed an alternative method for insertion in a binary search
tree which consists in adding a new root, instead of a leaf. This type
of insertion is useful when considering the <em>amortised</em> cost,
that is, the worst case of a series of updates. Indeed, if recently
added keys are searched, it is preferable that be located near the
root. One solution is based on a <em>small-step design</em>, in fact,
we simply consider how we can obtain a root with a key we have
inserted as a leaf. This method is the one we used when designing the
insertion at a leaf by considering the similarities and differences
with a simple search. Here, the first phase consists in going down in
the tree and creating a new leaf, but, instead of reconstructing the
path to the root on the way up, we perform rotations to bring the
inserted key at the root of the current subtree. If we inserted the
key in the right subtree, a <em>rotation to the left</em> will do
exactly this; conversely, if we inserted the key in the left subtree,
a <em>rotation to the right</em> will suffice. Therefore, when the
root of the tree is reached, we find that it is the inserted key. As
far as the implementation is concerned, we do not need to write a
method for each kind of rotations, because these are partial
functions, and we create a node (see the calls to the constructor
of <tt>Int&lt;Key></tt> in <tt>add</tt>) which is then discarded by
the rotations. Instead, we inline them.</p>

<p>Another functional approach to inserting a new root to a binary
search tree consists in defining a partition function, <tt>cut</tt>,
which, given a key <tt>k</tt>, returns two search trees such that the
keys of the first are smaller than <tt>k</tt>, and the keys of the
second are greater. Then, adding a root containing <tt>k</tt> and the
two previous trees as immediate subtrees is easy. The technical
difficulty is the use a generic <tt>Pair</tt> class which contains two
objects, which can be extracted on demand (Java lacks native
pairs):</p>
