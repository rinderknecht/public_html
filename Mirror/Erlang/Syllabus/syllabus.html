<h3>Syllabus of the Erlang course</h3>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to functional
programming by learning the basics of the functional language <a
href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a>. Only a subset of the
sequential subset of Erlang is presented (therefore, concurrency and
distributed computing are left out for lack of time).</p>

<p>Sequential Erlang is a purely functional subset of Erlang, which
means that it is free of side-effects. In other words, variables are
immutable entities: once they are bound to a value, this binding
cannot be undone (this is what assignments are for in imperative
languages).</p>

<p>We believe it is paramount that college students are introduced to
different computational paradigms as possible. While Erlang is
certainly the most commercially successful functional language, it is
not widely known outside the telecommunication and distributed
computing communities. Nonetheless, the concepts presented in this
course could result very handy if the future engineer is confronted to
another functional language, like XSLT.</p>

<p>The assumption of this course is that the simplicity of the syntax
of Erlang and the lack of static typing ease learning the basics of
functional programming. Also, it will be insisted a lot on the
complexity of the programs written, both time efficiency and space
efficiency.</p>

<h4>Plan</h4>

<ol>
  <li>A rationale for the study of Erlang. What is and and what is not
  off topic. Where to get the Erlang compiler, install it and use
  it. First program: the classical factorial function as defined in
  mathematics. The concept of counting the number of computation steps
  is introduced, based on the syntax of Erlang.</li>

  <li>The factorial function is rewritten so it uses an accumulating
  argument. It is shown that that, based on a rewriting model of
  Erlang program execution, the size of the term is constant. This
  contextual space, surrounding the function calls, is called the
  stack.</li>

  <li>Beyond integers, lists are the most useful data type in
  functional programming. Their operational model (a stack) is
  explained on examples. First programs on lists: computing the
  length, the last item and penultimate item. Versions without context
  are presented together with the direct encoding and it is explained
  the advantages and inconvenient of both. The context-free version is
  said to be in tail form and it is paramount to understand that all
  compilers for functional languages translate tail calls into loops
  at the assembly level. (In other words, it is as efficient as can be
  the source, which does not mean that the source is the most
  efficient version of all possible, of course)</li>

  <li>More exercises: how to compute the sum and the product of
  integers in a list. The number of steps is computed. A tail form and
  non-tail form are written and compared. The case of the product can
  be optimised in case a zero is present in the list: in this case the
  computation can be stopped as the result has to be zero. Through
  this example, the notion of worst-case and best-case input is
  introduced. The case of the empty list is discussed, as many
  students are tempted to return 0 in that case.</li>

  <li>The appending of two lists is presented in non-tail and tail
  forms. The number of steps in both cases is computed, as well as the
  number of pushes (which are taken as a measure of the memory
  consumption). The reversal of a list, in a direct form (that is,
  using only itself) of relying upon the appending are presented. The
  direct form happens to be in tail form and its advantages over the
  other form go beyond that: it is shown that the number of steps,
  that is, time efficiency, is linear in the length of the input in
  the first case, but quadratic in the second.</li>

  <li>Quiz</li>

  <li>Removal of the first occurrence of a given item in a given
  list. The students are left to judge whether the case of the empty
  list ought to be taken into account or not. This is a very important
  point. Most student associate the concept of nullity (as the number
  zero) with the concept of empty list, which is a wrong view,
  probably based on teachings from childhood where zero is explained
  by the analogy with an empty bag. As usual, non-tail and tail forms
  are envisaged and the number of steps is computed in the
  worst-case. The students are encouraged to systematically assess
  what is the worst-case input for the program they write, if
  any. Removal of all occurrences of a given item in a given
  list. Same with the removal of all occurrences. Comparison between
  them and the removal of the first occurrence only. The case of the
  empty list is left to the judgement of the students. Dropping items
  at periodic indexes in a list. This is the first example with two
  accumulators. Pairs are introduced and used to split a list at a
  given index. Efficiency and the extreme cases (out of bounds
  indexes, empty list) are detailed.</li>

  <li>Mid-term examination</li>

  <li>Atoms are presented by analogy with the enumerated values of C,
  or thought as read-only strings. The example of rotating a list is
  given as an exercise. The remainder of Euclidean division is
  presented. The difficulty for the student is to think negative
  rotations and to realise that they can be amenable to positive
  rotations.</li>

  <li>Guards are presented and the difference between (numerical)
  comparison and matching is insisted upon. The flattening of lists of
  lists is proposed as an exercise. This proves a stepping stone as it
  is the first frontal example of a list containing something else
  than integers or atoms. Also, it requires the traversing of a
  branching structure, announcing the forthcoming tree traversal. The
  case of the empty list, as usual is to be decided by the
  student. The lack of static typing makes the encoding more
  compact. It is mentioned in passing how it could be adapted to a
  strongly and statically typed functional language.</li>

  <li>The technique of using a list accumulator, which is reversed at
  the end is further wrought on by working on more and more exercises,
  like compressing a list of items in different ways. Sorting by
  insertion in a list of integers is explained. Different versions are
  presented and the number of steps in the worst-case (to be
  determined by the students) is computed. This is an example of
  quadratic behaviour, as far as speed is concerned.</li>

  <li>The limitation on sorting only integers and sorting only
  decreasingly is lifted by introducing functional parameters for the
  comparison function. Guards cannot be used anymore, so the <tt>case
  ... of ... end</tt> construct is presented and students are warned
  against it being used too liberally. The example of sorting a deck
  of cards is given as an example of the increased power that
  functional parameters offer.</li>

  <li>Binary trees are presented with the external node encoding that
  allows an easy matching of the nodes. The size of a tree, the sum of
  the integers in a tree and the height of a tree are presented. The
  similar shapes of these programs is underlined and the concept of a
  fold-up is introduced (a functional, i.e., a function with a
  functional parameter). These functions are rewritten using fold-up
  and the number of steps is sought. Tail forms are found and compared
  in terms of efficiency and compactness. The trade-off which consists
  in visiting the empty nodes (the external nodes) instead of stopping
  at the leave (if the tree contains <i>n</i> nodes, then there are
  <i>n+1</i> such empty nodes), in exchange of a shorter code is
  discussed.</li>

  <li>Quiz</li>

  <li>Preorder, postorder and inorder traversals on binary trees are
  introduced, first, by means of a fold-up, and then by using an
  auxiliary stack. The number of steps of both approaches is
  computed.</li>

  <li>Final examination</li>

</ol>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<p>None.</p>

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<p>There is only one recent book in English on Erlang, by Joe
Armstrong, one of the designers of Erlang, but this course does not
require any book in particular, as the focus is mainly in doing lots
of short homeworks.</p>

<h4>Evaluation</h4>

<p>Two examinations as usual, plus homeworks twice a week. Exercises
will be solved during class-time and answers posted on the web
site. Attendance will be checked and taken into account for the final
grade.</p>
